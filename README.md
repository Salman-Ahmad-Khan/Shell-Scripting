# Bash Scripting <br>

## Bash Shell Scripting <br> 
 ### Bash<br>
Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’.<br>
### Shell<br>
Shell is a macro processor which allows for an interactive or non-interactive command execution.<br>

Most likely, you are at the moment sitting in front of your computer, have a terminal window opened and wondering: “What should I do with this thing?” <br>

Well, the terminal window in front of you contains shell, and shell allows you by use of commands to interact with your computer, hence retrieve or store data, process information and various other simple or even extremely complex tasks. <br>

Try it now! Use your keyboard and type some commands such as date, cal, pwd or ls followed by the ENTER key. <br>
### Scripting<br>
Scripting allows for an automatic commands execution that would otherwise be executed interactively one-by-one.<br>

Now, imagine that the execution of all the above commands is your daily task. Every day you are required to execute all of the above commands without fail as well as store the observed information. Soon enough this will become an extremely tedious task destined for failure. Thus the obvious notion is to think of some way to execute all given commands together. This is where scripting becomes your salvation. <br>

To see what is meant by scripting, use shell in combination with your favorite text editor eg. vi to create a new file called task.sh containing all the above commands, each on a separate line. Once ready, make your new file executable using chmod command with an option +x. Lastly, execute your new script by prefixing its name with <span color="red">./</span>.
