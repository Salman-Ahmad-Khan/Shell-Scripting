Using if statement with OR logic:
‘||’ is used to define OR logic in if condition. Create a file named ‘ifWithOR.sh’ with the following code to check the use of OR logic of if statement. Here, the value of n will be taken from the user. If the value is equal to 15 or 45 then the output will be “You won the game”, otherwise the output will be “You lost the game”.
'

echo "Enter any number"
read n

if [[ ( $n -eq 15 || $n  -eq 45 ) ]]
then
echo "You won the game"
else
echo "You lost the game"
